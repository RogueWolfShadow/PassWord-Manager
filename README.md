# PassWord-Manager
A piece of software meant to assist in managing passwords.

Utilizes Java's Security and Crypto API in order to ensure maximum security.

How To use:
Upon the running this application, the program will show a keyboard onto the screen. If it is the first time you are running it, or there is no password set, then type in any combination to create a new password. Otherwise, type in your normal password. After typing in the password, you can click the asterisk button to enter in the manager. If the password is incorrect, then the program will not show the password management screen.
On the management screen, you can find accounts and passwords, add or remove new ones, or even update previously added login details. When you want to leave, you need to press the save button, and then the log out button. Closing the application by force after saving will still result in the file being saved.
